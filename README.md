# SolarICE
SolarICE theme for the ice window manager on X11.

## What is SolarICE?
SolarICE was made using [HP-UX](https://github.com/stephaneLabs/nIceCDE) by St√©phane Lassalvy as a base for windows design. This theme uses default [icewm](https://github.com/ice-wm/icewm) interfaces everywhere else. This is to make the packge lighter from fluff that I didn't use in the HP-UX theme.

## Why the colors?
SolarICE was meant to invision a fantasy computer during the early 90s. Heavly inspired by sunOS CDE (common desktop environment) created by sun microsystems.

### Are there different color options?
There is a bash script in `SolarICE/scripts/switch.sh` which uses `sed` to replace all windowing colors. Any task bar coloration will be left to the user.

## Background Options
All background options from [HP-UX](https://github.com/stephaneLabs/nIceCDE) are included and can be switched as the default background through a bash script located `SolarICE/scripts/background.sh` (Or by editing the `SolarICE/default.theme`).

# Installation
The paths are dependent on your icewm themes location being `~/.config/icewm/themes`. The only function dependent on this is the default background.
